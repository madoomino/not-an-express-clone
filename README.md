# some sort of nodejs framework pretends not to be an express-clone
### A Node.js framework that is meant to be an educational project to gain more knowledge about how Node.js & express actually work.

## Tasks

- Creating a very minimal library, which matches only one route.
  - creating a function that returns nodejs application.
  - creating an app object (the application base).
  - creating a router object (deals with routing).
  - creating route function (takes a path and chains different http methods on it).
  - creating Layer constructor (carries most of the route needs).
